# Music Tracks Manager

A simple React application for managing music tracks, built with Vite and Material-UI.

## Getting Started

To install dependencies and run the app locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Core Features

- **CRUD Modals**  
  Create and edit track metadata (title, artist, album, genres, cover image) in modal dialogs using React Router v6 modal routes.

- **Playback**  
  Play/pause inline by clicking the row, with a progress indicator at the bottom of the row.

- **Filtering & Search**  
  Filter tracks by artist, genre, and perform search by title, artist, or album.

- **Sorting**  
  Sort tracks by title, artist, album, or genre in ascending/descending order.

- **Pagination**  
  Server-side pagination with controls to navigate between pages and adjust items per page.

- **Form Validation**  
  Real-time and on-blur validation with React Hook Form for required fields and cover image URL format checks.

- **Default Cover Image**  
  Display a default placeholder when no cover image URL is provided.

- **Delete Confirmation**  
  Confirmation dialog before deleting a track.

- **Toast Notifications**  
  Success and error toasts for create, update, and delete operations using MUI Snackbar and Alert.

- **Loading States & Accessibility**  
  Loading indicators, disabled states with both `disabled` and `aria-disabled="true"`, and `data-loading="true"` attributes.  
  Each interactive element and form error has a `data-testid` for reliable testing.
